# Hi there!  I'm Imer Lopez

I'm a software developer with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly applications. I currently work as a Software Developer at Belize Bank Ltd., contributing to their financial infrastructure. Additionally, I leverage my expertise as a part-time contractor for a Software Development Firm.

While I'm constantly expanding my knowledge base, I'm particularly interested in exploring the exciting realms of mobile development and cybersecurity.

**Technical Skills**

I possess extensive experience in a diverse range of front-end and back-end technologies.
**Always Learning**

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and am actively delving into the world of AWS (Amazon Web Services) to enhance my cloud development capabilities.

**Interests**

Beyond the realm of code, I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving field of mobile development and the critical role cybersecurity plays in safeguarding our digital world.

**Let's Connect!**

I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow developers and explore new technical challenges. Feel free to reach out to me on:
